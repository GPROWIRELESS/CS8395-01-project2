# CS8395-01-project2
This is the project for CS8395-01 Augment Reality.
Development environment: Unity3D with Vuforia 10.5.5
In the project, I used a box instead of books since most of my books can't be recognized by vuforia engine. I used a Borad Game box, took photos for each plane and upload it to vuforia database.

The only code I write in this project is the C# Source file. There are three GameObject and two function in there. The GameObject are controlled by the interaction function. When the virtual button is pressed. The function will set the bookname and virtual button invisible. The book review will show at the same time. When the button is released, the review will disappear. The bookname and button will show again.
