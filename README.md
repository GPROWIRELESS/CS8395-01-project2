# CS8395-01-project2
This is the project for CS8395-01 Augment Reality.
Development environment: Unity3D with Vuforia 10.5.5
In the project, I used a box instead of books since most of my books can't be recognized by vuforia engine. I used a Borad Game box, took photos for each plane and upload it to vuforia database.
